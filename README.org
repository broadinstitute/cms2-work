#+TITLE: CMS2 workflows

Workflows to run population genetics simulations and compute component scores for CMS2.

* WDL workflow organization

  The top-level workflow is [[./cms2_main.wdl][cms2_main.wdl]] .  It is really a wrapper workflow, meant to hide many internal details/parameters.

  
* Docker images

  The docker image that is used for component score computation tasks, is specified by docker/cms2-docker-component-stats/Dockerfile .
  It is automatically constructed by Travis CI on pushes to the repo cms2-docker-component-stats, and pushed to 
  quay.io/ilya_broad/cms .  Currently, after updating that, you have to manually update the docker runtime attribute
  in each task in tassk.wdl; this should be automated.
